- Fix the sounds not playing
- Terminal shakes and turns red subtly on wrong command
- The whole student row shoult turn red while decrementing, and maybe the incrementing one's turn yellow
- Also slow the process of decrementing and incrementing a liiitle bit, and increase the size of the incrementing and decrementing numbers/arrows/+ and -
- The progress bar should show the progress of the hacking, and above the progress bar instead of "hacking" it should say "Working with work, please wait..." (it's an easter egg)
- Also i guess the progressbar and the easter egg should be a lighter green, for prominence
- The successful screen before the end credits, bring that back
- Finally, the end credits should stop scrolling once [logout] is at the very center
